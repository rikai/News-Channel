The 'AlternateSprites' folder contains different newscasters you can choose from if you don't want to use the default one.



There's a female version for those who prefer a female reporter or use genderswap NPC mods. 


There's also an anthro version if you want more of an Animal Crossing style, or use Gaveliere's character mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1083).



To replace, copy the version you want, place it in the 'assets' folder, rename it 'news.png', and overwrite the original (be sure to make a backup!)
